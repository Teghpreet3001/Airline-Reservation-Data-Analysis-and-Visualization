# Airline-Reservation-Data-Analysis-and-Visualization

Airline Reservation-Data Analysis and Visualization is a project that tries to computerise the functioning of Airline Reservation system, by accessing Data stored in MS Excel based CSV files through Python Programming Language (Version-3.7 and IDLE-Jupyter Notebook) and its built in libraries like Numpy (Mathematical Operations), Pandas (Data Analysis) and Matplotlib.pyplot (Data Visualization). The project also explores MySQL (Version-5.7.3) and uses a different subset of queries to work in between Python and MySQL softwares.

The projects involves extensive data exploration and hence, takes care of handling customersâ€™ reservation and maintaining their records in various databases in MySQL, providing a Structured Query Language (SQL) environment. 

One can book tickets as and when required, compare various flights at different times, based on their respective locations, time zones and durations, through clear charts and graphs accomplished by data visualisation through Matplotlib.

Through a clear manual simulation of Airline Records stored in CSV files, one can check flights for different destinations, check whether flight is on time or not, duration of flight etc. 

The data system also provides the facility to book tickets for themselves by entering details like name, address, phone number etc, as provided by user friendly queries from Pandas Library.

In this project, we have appointed the one table one menu format, wherein each table is assigned a specific type of menu depending upon the type of data it holds, Airline_Details (for Data Entry and Exploration), Passenger_Details (for Data Analysis) and Ticket (Data Visualization).
